## About Project 
The objective of the project is to develop an AI-based Student Inquiry Assistant to assist in managing reoccurring student enquiries in their academics and improve the quality of academic responses through the usage of artificial intelligence. The project aims to deliver a web-based application that incorporates AI to help lectures handle student enquiries effectively and a user-friendly interface for student inquiry for both students and lecturers to use and the usage of AI-based technologies. The following are the project’s main goals: 

- Text classification technologies – Natural Learning Processing (NLP) and Elasticsearch to accurately understand students’ inquiries. There would also be a Feedback Mechanism for students’ insights on the system to improve it and to solve unresolved queries that need lectures’ manual support.  
- Integration with LMS (Learning Management System) and databases – We can connect it to the university’s LMS which is Canvas, to allow the AI system to access course materials and resources for its responses to students. There will be both a front-end and back-end infrastructure that will support the AI model in the storage of data and handling of the database.  
- System Architecture Documentation – Documentation of architecture, system design decisions and drafts with a guide and detailed manuals of usage of the system for future needs for maintenance or development.
